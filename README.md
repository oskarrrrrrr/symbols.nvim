# symbols.nvim

Sidebar with a list of symbols. Gives an overview of a file and allows quick
navigation.

> **Warning**
>
> `symbols.nvim` is in beta. You may encounter bugs and breaking changes.
> For a more stable experience use tags (e.g. "v0.1.0") with you plugin manager.

## Features

- **Listing Symbols** - duh. Uses LSP servers and treesitter parsers which have to
  be configured by the user.
- **Fuzzy Search** - fuzzy search symbols directly from the sidebar
- **Preview Window** - glance at the code before committing to your next action.
  You can also edit the file in the preview window.
- **Inline Details** - symbol details can be displayed inline. Those details are
  given by a provider (e.g. LSP).
- **Dynamic Settings** - some of the settings can be changed on the fly, without
  changing the config and reopening Neovim.
- **Preserving Folds** - the sidebar preserves folds on changes (at least most of
  them, most of the time).
- **Independent Sidebars** - each sidebar has it's own view (folds) and settings,
  even when there are multiple sidebars showing symbols for the same file.
- **Custom Display Rules** - symbols formatting and filtering can be configured per
  language. The goal is to provide great default configurations for many
  languages while allowing the user to make adjusments according to their
  preference.
- **Mouse Support** - you can use your mouse, no judgement.

# Requirements

- Neovim 0.10+
- LSP servers for desired languages
- Treesitter parsers (see [Supported Languages](#supported-languages))

# Quick Start

Using lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
    "oskarrrrrrr/symbols.nvim",
    config = function()
        local r = require("symbols.recipes")
        require("symbols").setup(r.DefaultFilters, r.AsciiSymbols, {
            -- custom settings here
            -- e.g. hide_cursor = false
        })
        vim.keymap.set("n", ",s", "<cmd> Symbols<CR>")
        vim.keymap.set("n", ",S", "<cmd> SymbolsClose<CR>")
    end
}
```

# Supported Languages

There are two sources of symbols that are displayed in the sidebar:
1. LSP servers configured by the user (for example with [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim))
2. Treesitter parsers installed by the user (for example with `TSInstall` command)

Virtually any LSP server should work with the sidebar.

Languages supported through treesitter (Treesitter parser name in brackets):
- Markdown (markdown)
- Vimdoc (vimdoc)
- Org (org)
- JSON (json)
- JSON Lines (json)
- Makefile (make)

When a language is supported by both sources, the LSP servers take precedence
over Treesitter.

# Tips

## Help

Press `?` in the sidebar to see the available keymaps or run `:help symbols`.

## Fuzzy Search

Press `s` to start a fuzzy search. Use `<S-Tab>` and `<Tab>` to go up and down
the search results list without leaving the prompt window or navigate the search
history with `<C-j>` and `<C-k>`. Go to symbol with `<Cr>` or press `<Esc>` to
focus the search results window and peek symbols with `o`. Press `<Esc>` again
to go back to the symbols list or press `q` to close the sidebar.

## Preview Window

Press the preview window keymap (by default "K") once to open it, the second
time to jump to it. You can now move around the buffer and make changes. Press
"q" to close the window or jump to the sidebar if auto preview is on. Yes, this
means that by default you can't record macros in the preview window.

## Keymaps

How to remove a default keymap? Just set the value to `nil`.

## Dynamic Settings

A lot of settings can be changed on the fly by using keymaps starting with "t".
For example, try out "td" to toggle inline details, "t=" to toggle sidebar auto
resizing or "tp" to toggle auto preview.

## Inline Details

By pressing "td" you can show inline details which are provided by some LSP
servers. They give useful information about certain symbols. For instance, for
a function the details might be the function params, for a variable it might be
the initial value.
Examples of languages that have nice support for details are Lua, Go and Rust.
On the flip side, Javascript and Python do not show any details.

## Navigation

Sometimes you want to get to a deeply nested symbol and unfold all the symbols
on the way. To do that for the symbol under the cursor in the source window
press "gs" when in the sidebar. Other useful mappings for more advanced
navigation are:

- "\[\[" and "\]\]" to go to the previous and next symbol on the same
  level. Can be used with a count.
- "gp" to go to parent symbol, can be used with a count.
- "L"/"zO" and "H"/"zC" for recursively opening and closing folds under the
  cursor . Useful for changing only part of the tree, whereas "zr", "zR", "zm"
  and "zM" affect the whole tree.

You can navigate the sidebar with a mouse. Left click to select a symbol,
double click to toggle fold, right click to peek the symbol.

## Big Files

To work with really big files in Neovim you have to turn off LSPs, treesitter
and more. You can do that with some custom lua code or use a plugin like:
`LunarVim/bigfile.nvim`. The sidebar will not work when LSPs and treesitter are
turned off thus causing no slow downs.

What if you notice slow downs while working on a file of reasonable size?

- If you notice slow downs when moving the cursor around then try setting
  `sidebar.cursor_follow` to false.
- If you notice lagging on save then it might be the sidebar refreshing. For
  now the only solution is to stop using the plugin with large files.
- You can let me know about the problem via issues on GitHub.

# Commands

- `:Symbols[!]` A command designed to be used as your main mapping. Opens the
  Symbols sidebar and jumps to it unless called with the bang (`!`). If called
  when the sidebar is already open then jumps to it regardless of the bang.
  When called in a sidebar jumps back to the source code.
- `:SymbolsToggle[!]` An alternative main mapping. Opens the sidebar and jumps
  to it unless called with the bang (`!`). Closes the sidebar if already open.
- `:SymbolsOpen[!]` Opens the sidebar and jumps to it unless called with the
  bang (`!`).
- `:SymbolsClose` Closes the sidebar.

# Configuration

To use the plugin you must run the setup function: `require("symbols").setup()`.
Setup function takes any number of config arguments which will be merged with
the default config.

There are a few predefined recipes (configs) that you can use:

- DefaultFilters - filters out excessive symbols. For example, the Lua LSP
  server provides a symbol for each `if`, `elseif`, `else` and `for` and they
  are discarded by this config.
- AsciiSymbols - symbol kind displayed as text. For instance, "Function" kind 
  might be displayed as "fun", "fn", "func" or "def" depending on the language.
- FancySymbols - symbol kind will be displated as an icon. Needs `lspkind.nvim`.

The recipes are available in `symbols.recipes` module.

# API

There is now a (currently very simple) API available to control the Sidebar from LUA

```lua
  ---perform any action defined in SidebarAction
  ---@param act SidebarAction[]
  action = function(act)
    local sidebar = apisupport_getsidebar()
    if sidebar ~= nil and sidebar_actions[act] ~= nil then
      sidebar_actions[act](sidebar)
    end
  end,
  ---manually refresh the symbols in the current sidebar
  refresh_symbols = function()
    local sidebar = apisupport_getsidebar()
    if sidebar ~= nil then
      sidebar:refresh_symbols()
    end
  end
```
The available actions can be obtained by calling

```lua
=require("symbols.config").SidebarAction
```

For example, to unfold the entire tree you would call:

```lua
require("symbols").api.action("unfold-all")
```
